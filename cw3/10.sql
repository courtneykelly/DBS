/*	Query 10
	Two studio albums are consecutive if they are released in different years, say Y1 and Y2, and there is no
	studio album released strictly between Y1 and Y2. Find artists who have never released two consecutive
	studio albums more than 4 years apart. Artists who have released less than 2 studio albums in total
	do satisfy this condition and must be included in the output. Return the artistâ€™s name.
