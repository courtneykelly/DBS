/*	Query 9
	For each customer who has placed at least two orders, calculate the longest number of days ever elapsed
	between any one order and the next. The only case in which this interval (which you can calculate as
	the difference of two dates) will be zero is for customers who placed at least two orders and all of them
	were placed in the same day. Whether an order has a detail is irrelevant. Return the customer ID and
	the corresponding interval (which will be an integer).
