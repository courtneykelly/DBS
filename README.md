# Database Systems

Databases are essential to maintaining the information base in almost all modern business enterprises and to electronic commerce. They are also becoming increasingly important as a fundamental tool in much scientific research. Some knowledge of databases is now essential in any of these areas. The study of databases draws on several disciplines within computer science: logic, algorithms, programming languages and operating systems.

This course is an introduction to the principles underlying the design and implementation of databases and database management systems. It will cover the theoretical and practical languages that have been developed for relational databases, their implementation and optimisation. It will also cover transaction processing and concurrency control, as well as tools and techniques for decision support and data analysis.

In addition, some recent developments in databases, including semistructured data and the relationship between relational databases and XML documents, will be introduced.
